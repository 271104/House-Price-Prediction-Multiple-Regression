# House Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This project involves the implementation of a **Multiple Linear Regression** model to predict house prices using multiple independent features from the dataset.

## Objective

- Build a predictive model using multiple input features to estimate house prices.
- Analyze the impact of each feature on the predicted outcome.
- Evaluate the model's accuracy and interpret the regression coefficients.

## Dataset

The dataset used contains various attributes of houses such as:

- Area (in square feet)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Location or ZIP code (if applicable)
- Price (target variable)

**File Name:** House_Prices_Dataset.csv (or any relevant housing dataset)

## Concepts Covered

- Multiple Linear Regression
- Feature Selection and Multicollinearity
- Data Normalization or Standardization
- Model Training and Testing
- Model Evaluation (R² Score, Adjusted R², Mean Squared Error)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for modeling and evaluation)

## Workflow Summary

1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Handle missing values and encode categorical features (if present).
3. Analyze relationships between variables.
4. Train a multiple regression model using the selected features.
5. Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.
6. Interpret regression coefficients to understand feature importance.

## Conclusion

Multiple linear regression allows for more accurate predictions by considering the effect of several features on the target variable. This model is ideal for scenarios where price depends on more than one attribute, providing a foundation for more complex regression techniques.
